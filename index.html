		<h1> Cute Duck Breeds</h1>
		<p> Ducks can go in variations such as having different sizes in beaks, different body weight, different environment type, and more. In my opinion, some of the cutest duck breed is the Call Duck, Pekin Duck, and the Aylesbury Duck. </p>

		<h1>Preferred Food For Ducks</h1>
		<p> Ducks have certain nutritional needs just like most animals, ducks need cracked corn, birdseeds, peas, and lettuce for their daily meal to ensure the duck has good health for a long period. </p>
